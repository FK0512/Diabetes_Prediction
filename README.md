ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction using SVM (Linear Kernel)
This project uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel to build a predictive model for early detection of diabetes. It classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on key health indicators.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes, based on diagnostic measurements.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Name: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Samples: 768

ðŸ§  Model
We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel, which is suitable for linearly separable data and offers strong performance for binary classification tasks.
